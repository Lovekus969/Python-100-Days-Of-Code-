# Python-100-Days-Of-Code-
This is my new Repo where we learn all about python and its Functions like how they perform and everything .

Quick Strategy for 100 Days of Code:
    Day 1–20: Python basics (variables, loops, conditionals, functions, lists, dicts, sets).

 Step 1: Python Fundamentals (2–3 weeks)

                    ✅ Variables, Data types (int, float, bool, str, list, dict, set, tuple)
                    ✅ Conditionals (if-elif-else)
                    ✅ Loops (for, while)
                    ✅ Functions & Parameters (default, keyword, *args, **kwargs)
                    ✅ Strings & Lists operations
                    ✅ File handling (read/write)
                    ✅ Error handling (try/except)
                    ✅ OOP basics (class, object, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation)
                    ✅ Modules & Packages (import, pip)

 Day 21–40: Data structures (linked list, stack, queue, trees) + recursion.
 Day 41–60: Algorithms (sorting, searching, DP basics) + small coding challenges.
 Day 61–80: Mini-projects (calculator, todo app, mini-game, file handling).
 Day 81–100: Bigger project (barber shop app, wedding planner in Python, or automation scripts) + LeetCode medium/hard problems.
