# Python-100-Days-Of-Code-
This is my new Repo where we learn all about python and its Functions like how they perform and everything .

Quick Strategy for 100 Days of Code:
    Day 1–20: Python basics (variables, loops, conditionals, functions, lists, dicts, sets).
      
    Day 21–40: Data structures (linked list, stack, queue, trees) + recursion.
    Day 41–60: Algorithms (sorting, searching, DP basics) + small coding challenges.
    Day 61–80: Mini-projects (calculator, todo app, mini-game, file handling).
    Day 81–100: Bigger project (barber shop app, wedding planner in Python, or automation scripts) + LeetCode medium/hard problems.
