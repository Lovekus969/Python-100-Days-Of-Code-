Escape Character:

An escape character in Python is a backslash (\) followed by a character, used to insert characters that are otherwise illegal or have special meaning inside a string literal.
It allows embedding quotes, newlines, tabs, Unicode, or other control characters without breaking the syntax.

Syntax: \ + character

Common use cases: quotes inside strings, newline \n, tab \t, backslash \\, Unicode \uXXXX.
