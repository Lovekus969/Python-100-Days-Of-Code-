String slicing is the process of extracting a substring from a given string using index positions, defined by the syntax:

string[start:end:step]

Time & Space Complexity: =>>

        Time Complexity: O(k), where k is the length of the slice (because Python iterates through the required characters).
        Space Complexity: O(k), since a new substring is created.
