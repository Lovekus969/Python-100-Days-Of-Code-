F-Strings (f"") are the modern, preferred way to format strings in Python (since version 3.6).
They let you directly embed variables, expressions, and even function calls inside {} without needing +, .format(), or %.


in Python f-strings, placeholders {} can contain:

                                              Variables
                                              Expressions / operations
                                              Function calls
                                              Format specifiers (modifiers)
