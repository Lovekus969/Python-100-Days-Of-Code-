Loops in Python

Loops are used when we want to repeat a block of code multiple times.
Python has two main types of loops:

1. For Loop => Used when we know how many times we want to run the loop.

Example 1 – Simple for loop

                                  for i in range(5):
                                      print("Hello, Beeba Boys!", i)

2. While Loop=>  Used when we don’t know how many times to run, but we know the condition.

Example 1 – Basic while loop

                                    count = 1
                                    while count <= 5:
                                        print("Customer number:", count)
                                        count += 1

Print numbers from 1 to 100.

If divisible by 3 → print "Fizz"

If divisible by 5 → print "Buzz"

If divisible by both → print "FizzBuzz"
