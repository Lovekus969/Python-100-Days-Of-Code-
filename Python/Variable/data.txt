What is a Variable?

A variable is like a container used to store data in memory.
In Python, you don’t need to declare the type explicitly — it figures it out automatically (dynamic typing).

##Strign we use double quote " Everyrhing inside is string " 

## int 

number = 23
##  What is a float in Python?

A float is a number with a decimal point.

It stands for floating-point number.
##  What is a Boolean?

A Boolean (bool) is a data type that can only have two values:

True

False

Think of it like a switch (ON / OFF) or yes / no.
