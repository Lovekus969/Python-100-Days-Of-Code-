Variables
Variables are containers for storing data values.
Creating Variables
Python has no command for declaring a variable.

A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
What is a Variable?

A variable is like a container used to store data in memory.
In Python, you don’t need to declare the type explicitly — it figures it out automatically (dynamic typing).

Variable Names
          A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).

Rules for Python variables:

          A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
          A variable name cannot start with a number
          A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
          Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
          A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.
Global Variables
Variables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the examples in the previous pages) are known as global variables. Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.

##Strign we use double quote " Everyrhing inside is string " 

## int 

number = 23
##  What is a float in Python?

A float is a number with a decimal point.

It stands for floating-point number.
##  What is a Boolean?

A Boolean (bool) is a data type that can only have two values:
  Think of it like a switch (ON / OFF) or yes / no.

q  What does type() do?
    
    It tells you the data type of a variable or value.
