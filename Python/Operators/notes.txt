Operator := Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

1 . Arithmetic Operators
`````    Used for basic math.
2.Comparison Operators
        Always return True / False.
3. Logical Operators
        Used with booleans.
4. Assignment Operators
        Assign values and perform operations.

Left Shift (<<)

                                Shifts all bits to the left by the specified number of positions.
                                Each left shift = multiply the number by 2
Right Shift (>>)

                                Shifts all bits to the right by the specified number of positions.
                                Each right shift = divide the number by 2 (ignores remainder).

Python divides the operators in the following groups:

Arithmetic operators
Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Logical operators
Identity operators
Membership operators
Bitwise operators


Python Membership Operators

Membership operators test whether a value is present in a sequence (like string, list, tuple, set, or dictionary).

ðŸ”¹ Two Membership Operators:

in â†’ Returns True if the value exists in the sequence.

not in â†’ Returns True if the value does not exist in the sequence.
