Built-in Data Types
In programming, data type is an important concept.
Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

Text Type:	str
Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
Mapping Type:	dict
Set Types:	set, frozenset
Boolean Type:	bool
Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
None Type:	NoneType
                                                                        Touple  vs   List 

Syntax

List: uses square brackets []

[1, 2, 3]


Tuple: uses parentheses ()

(1, 2, 3)

Performance

Tuples are slightly faster than lists because they are immutable.

If you donâ€™t need to change the data, using a tuple is better.
