Built-in Data Types
In programming, data type is an important concept.
Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

Text Type:	str
Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
Mapping Type:	dict
Set Types:	set, frozenset
Boolean Type:	bool
Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
None Type:	NoneType
                                                                        Touple  vs   List 

Syntax

List: uses square brackets []

[1, 2, 3]


Tuple: uses parentheses ()

(1, 2, 3)

Performance

Tuples are slightly faster than lists because they are immutable.

If you don’t need to change the data, using a tuple is better.

Basic Concept
      Set	A collection of unique elements, unordered.
      Dict	A collection of key-value pairs, unordered (keys are unique).

1. What is None?

None is a special constant in Python that represents the absence of a value or nothing.

It’s like saying: “There is nothing here” or “No value assigned.”

2.Type of None
x = None
print(type(x))  # <class 'NoneType'>


So NoneType is the type of None.
Only one value exists of this type: None itself.
