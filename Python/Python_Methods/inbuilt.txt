String Methods
Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on strings.

1. capitalize()
      Definition :=>> Converts the first character of the string to uppercase and the rest to lowercase. Returns a new string (strings are immutable).

Time Complexity: O(n) — because it scans the entire string.
Space Complexity: O(n) — creates a new string.

2.casefold()
            Definition:=> Converts a string to lowercase in a more aggressive way than lower(), suitable for case-insensitive comparisons, including Unicode characters.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)

3.center(width, fillchar=' ')

            Definition:=>> Returns a new string of specified width with the original string centered. Fills extra spaces with the optional fillchar (default: space).

Time Complexity: O(n + width)
Space Complexity: O(width)
