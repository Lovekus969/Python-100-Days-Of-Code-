Python vs C++ – Theory (Typed & Structured)
     Type System

          Python: Dynamically typed
          Variables don’t need a type declaration.
          Type is determined at runtime.
     C++: Statically typed

          Every variable must have a declared type.

Memory Management

               Python: Automatic (garbage collected)                       C++: Manual or semi-automatic
               No need to manually allocate or free memory.                  Use new/delete for dynamic memory.
                                                                                Stack memory is automatic.


Performance

               Python: Slower, interpreted
               C++: Faster, compiled
               Use C++ for performance-critical applications.
               Use Python for quick development / scripts / AI / web.
