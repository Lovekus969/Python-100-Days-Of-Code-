What is a Collection in Python?

A collection is a container that is used to store multiple items (values, objects) in a single variable.
Instead of storing one item at a time, collections let you group data together.

Python Collections

                Dynamic size (you can add/remove items anytime).
                Can store mixed data types in one collection.
                Different types available (list, tuple, set, dict).
“Python collections are like arrays in Java, but more powerful because they can grow dynamically and hold different types of data.”
