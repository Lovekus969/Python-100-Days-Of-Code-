Dictionary in Python

What it is:
    
    A built-in data structure (like dict) that stores key-value pairs.
    
    Internally implemented using hash tables.

Features:

    Keys must be hashable (immutable types like strings, numbers, tuples).
    
    Lookup, insertion, and deletion are O(1) on average.
    
    Syntax is very easy

Your Case: Product ID → Product Name

    At Walmart, the manager wants you to store data like:

                Product ID: 101 → Product Name: "Milk"
                
                Product ID: 102 → Product Name: "Rice"
                
                Product ID: 103 → Product Name: "Shampoo"

        This is a key–value relationship:

        Key = Product ID (unique, like barcode/ID)

Value = Product Name (details of the product)
