Dictionary in Python

What it is:
    
    A built-in data structure (like dict) that stores key-value pairs.
    
    Internally implemented using hash tables.

Features:

    Keys must be hashable (immutable types like strings, numbers, tuples).
    
    Lookup, insertion, and deletion are O(1) on average.
    
    Syntax is very easy
